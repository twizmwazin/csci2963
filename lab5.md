###Comparison
Ruma and Submitty have the largest history and the most interesting statistics.
The busiest time of day for submitty is 3-4 pm. Notably, there have been almost
commits made between 4 and 8 am, I guess everyone sleeps then. In contrast,
ruma developers check the most commits in from 5-10 am.

Another difference is the growth of the project size. Submitty began small and
then exploded in size from around 100 to 600 files. On the other hand ruma
seems to grow gradually.
